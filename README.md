  This application is a delivery boy system for restaurants. The officially aggreed restaurants are added to the database
with a password and a unique username. 

  When a restaurant manager gets logged in, he/she is directed to the call page. In the call page, the restaurant may call
a delivery boy with just a simple address input and a call button. Then the request goes to admin panel with a visual and
an audio warning. After the acknowledgement, the table in the admin panel refreshes and the new request is set to seen
in the first row of the admin panel table. 

  In the admin panel, the admin can make a delivery boy appointment, just by clicking the appointment button and selecting
the appropriate delivery boy. After the appointment, the admin panel table gets refreshed, the appointment button changes
its color and label and the appointed delivery boy gets called with a visual and an audio warning. After the delivery boy's
acknowledgement, his or her page gets directed to the navigation panel with a route planning.
